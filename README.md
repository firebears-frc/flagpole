# flagpole
Arduino programs for our Neopixel flag.

Actually, this runs on a Trinket from Adafruit: <https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket>.  Within the Arduino IDO, choose the board of "Adafruit Trinket 8Hhz" and the programmer set to "USBtinyISP".

The Trinket/Gemma library may be preinstalled in your Arduino IDE program.  If it isn't, install the library:  <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/arduino-1-dot-6-x-ide>

To load code from the Arduino IDE, first push the reset button on the Trinket, and then load code before the LED stops pulsing.  You'll have about ten seconds.
